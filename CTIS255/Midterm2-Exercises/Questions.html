        <h3>Question #14</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="question">Write a JavaScript program that imports <b>q14_db.js</b> file to access three object arrays and builds a report called “Attendance Report”. The report is based on the contents of those arrays. You will analyze and understand the structure of those arrays, and find the relations among them. The report basically displays the attendances of all students in the courses. For a student, it displays her name, surname, city, cgpa and attendance percentage.   
                City will be a select box. It is not static, and it is built from the cities in the “students” array. The cities in the list are ordered alphabetically, and there is no duplication, and appropriate city is selected for each student. 
                Attendance is a bar chart. Bar container’s width is 100px, its height is 15px, background color is #DDD, and border color is #AAA.  If the attendance is greater than 60, the bar in the bar container will be green otherwise, it will be red. The bar chart’s width is given in “attendances” array for each student. 
                Each course is a separate table with a width of 500px. It has a collapsed borders, and its border color is #AAA. It uses a strip pattern (alternating background colors, #F0F0F0 and #FFF) for student rows. The first row contains course code and name. It is bold and centered, and its background color is #CCC. The second row shows the titles of each column. They are bold and italic, and they have a bottom border which is “4px double black”. Each cell has a 5px padding.
