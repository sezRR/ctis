Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:
- Size of the area covered
- Number of users connected
- Number and types of services available
- Area of responsibility

Two most common types of network infrastructures are LAN (local area networks) and WAN (wide area networks).

A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area.
- A LAN is typically used in a department within an enterprise, a home, or a small business network.

A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider (or ISPs: internet service providers).

## LAN
A LAN is a network infrastructure that spans a small geographical area. LANs have specific characteristics:
- LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
- A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies.
- LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary devices.

In the above figure: A network serving a home, small building, or a small campus is considered a LAN.

## WANs
A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or internet service providers (ISPs).

WANs have specific characteristics:
- WANs are interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
- WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
- WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.
