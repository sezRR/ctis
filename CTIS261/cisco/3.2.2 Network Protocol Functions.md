Network communication protocols are responsible for a variety of functions necessary for network communications between end devices.

![[3.2.2 Network Protocol Functions - Figure 1.png]]

Computers and network devices use agreed-upon protocols to communicate. The table lists the functions of these protocols:

| Function              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addressing            | This identifies the sender and the intended receiver of the message using a defined addressing scheme. <br><br>Examples of protocols that provide addressing include Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6.                                                                                                        |
| Reliability           | This function provides guaranteed delivery mechanisms in case messages are lost or corrupted in transit. <br><br>TCP provides guaranteed delivery.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Flow Control          | This function ensures that data flows at an efficient rate between two communicating devices. <br><br>TCP provides flow control services.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Sequencing            | This function uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data.<br><br>The receiving devices uses the sequencing information to re-assemble the information correctly.<br><br>This is useful if the data segment are lost, delayed or received out-of-order.<br><br>TCP provides sequencing services. |
| Error Detection       | This function is used to determine if data became corrupted during transmission.<br><br>Various protocols that provide error detection include:<br><br>Ethernet<br>IPv4<br>IPv6<br>TCP                                                                                                                |
| Application Interface | This function contains information used for process-to-process communications between network applications.<br><br>For example, when accessing a web page, HTTP or HTTPS protocols are used to communicate between the client and server web processes.                                               |
