Quality of Services (QoS) is an increasing requirement of networks today. QoS becomes a primary mechanism for managing congestion and ensuring reliable delivery of content to all users.

Congestion occurs when the demand for bandwidth exceeds the amount available. Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or bits per second (**bps**).

When simultaneous communications are attempted across the network, the demand for network bandwidth can exceed its availability, creating network congestion.

When the volume of  traffic is greater than what can be transported across the network, devices will hold the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them.

With a QoS policy in place, the router can manage the flow of data and voice traffic, giving priority to voice communications if the network experiences congestion. The focus of QoS is to prioritize time-sensitive traffic. The type of traffic, not the content of the traffic, is what is important.
