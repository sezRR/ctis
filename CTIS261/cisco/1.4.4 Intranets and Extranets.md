Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization.

An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.

An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization's data. Here are some examples of extranets:

- A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors
- A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors, so they can make appointments for their patients.
- A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district.
