Segmented messages will not go anywhere if they are not addressed properly.

The network and data link layers are responsible for delivering data from the source device to the destination device.

Protocols at both layers contain a source and destination address, but their addresses have different purposes:

- **Network layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the IP packet from the original source to the final destination, which may be on the same network or a remote network.
- **Data link layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the data link frame from one network interface card (NIC) to another (NIC) on the same network.
