The network infrastructure, services and the data contained on network-attached devices are crucial personal and business assets. Network administrators must address two types of network security concerns:
- Network infrastructure
- Information security

Securing the network infrastructure includes physically securing devices that provide network connectivity and preventing unauthorized access to the management software that resides on them.

Network administrators must also protect the information contained within the packets being transmitted over the network, and the information stored on network attached devices.

In order to achieve the goals of network security, there are three primary requirements:

- **Confidentiality:** Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data.
- **Integrity:** Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination.
- **Availability:** Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users.
