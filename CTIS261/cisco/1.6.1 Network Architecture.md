Have you ever been busy working online, only to have “the internet go down”? As you know by now, the internet did not go down, you just lost your connection to it. 

It is very frustrating. With so many people in the world relying on network access to work and learn, it is imperative that networks are reliable.

Reliability means more than your connection to the internet. This topic focuses on the four aspects of network reliability.

For networks to function efficiently and grow in this type of environment, the network must be built upon a standard network architecture.

Networks also support a wide range of applications and services. They must operate over many different types of cables and devices, which make up the physical infrastructure. The term network architecture, in this context, refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure and the programmed services and rules, or protocols, **that move data across the network.**

As networks evolve, we have learned that there are four basic characteristics that network architects must address to meet user expectations:

- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security
