TCP/IP protocols are available for the application, transport, and internet layers. There are no TCP/IP protocols in the network access layer.

The most common network access layer LAN protocols are Ethernet and WLAN (wireless LAN) protocols. Network access layer protocols are responsible for delivering the IP packet over the physical medium.

The figure in the below, shows an example of the three TCP/IP protocols used to send packets between the web browser of a host and the web server.

HTTP, TCP, and IP are the TCP/IP protocols used.

At the network access layer, Ethernet is used in the example. However, this could also be a wireless standard such as WLAN or cellular service.
