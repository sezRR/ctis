Simply having a wired or wireless physical connection between end devices is not enough to enable communication. For communication to occur, devices must know "how" to communicate.

People exchange ideas using many different communication methods. However, all communication methods have the following three elements in common:
- Sender (message source): Message sources are people, or electronic devices, that need to send a message to other individuals or devices.
- Receiver (message destination): The destination receives the message and interprets it.
- Channel: Consists of the media that provides the pathway over which the message travels from source to destination.
