Message timing is also very important in network communications. Message timing includes the following:

- **Flow Control:** This is the process of managing the rate of data transmission. Flow control defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered.
	- For example: If one person speaks too quickly, it may be difficult for the receiver to hear and understand the message. In network communication, there are network protocols used by the source and destination devices to negotiate and manage the flow of information.
- **Response Timeout:** If a person asks a question and does not hear a response within an acceptable amount of time, the person assumes that no answer is coming and reacts accordingly. The person may repeat the question or instead, may go on with the conversation.
	- Hosts on the network use network protocols that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a response timeout occurs. (Timers)
- **Access Method:** Determines when someone can send a message. Likewise, when a device wants to transmit on a wireless LAN, it is necessary for the WLAN network interface card (NIC) to determine whether the wireless medium is available.
