Encoding between hosts must be in an appropriate format for the medium.

Messages sent across the network are first converted into bits by the sending host. Each bit is **encoded** into a pattern of voltages on copper wires, infrared light in optical fibers, or microwaves for wireless systems.

The destination host receives and decodes the signals to interpret the message.
