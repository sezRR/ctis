When the sender and receiver of the IP packet are on the same network, the data link frame is sent directly to the receiving device.

On an Ethernet network, the data link addresses are known as Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.

MAC addresses are physically embedded on the Ethernet NIC.
- **Source MAC address** - This is the data link address, or the Ethernet MAC address, of the device that sends the data link frame with the encapsulated IP packet. The MAC address of the Ethernet NIC of PC1 is *AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA*, written in hexadecimal notation.
- **Destination MAC address** - When the receiving device is on the same network as the sending device, this is the data link address of the receiving device. In this example, the destination MAC address is the MAC address of the FTP server: *CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC*, written in hexadecimal notation.

The frame with the encapsulated IP packet can now be transmitted from PC1 directly to the FTP server.
