There are many different manufacturers of network components, they must all use the same standards. In networking, standards are developed by international standards organizations.

Open standards encourage interoperability, competition, and innovation. They also guarantee that the product of no single company can monopolize the market or have an unfair advantage over its competition.

These open standards also allow a client running the *Apple OS X* operating system to download a web page from a web server running the *Linux* operating system. This is because both operating systems implement the open standard protocols, such as those in the TCP/IP protocol suite.
