End devices to be able to communicate over a network, each device must abide by the same set of rules. These rules are called protocols.

Network protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages between devices.

Protocols are implemented by end devices and intermediary devices in software, hardware or both.

Each network protocol has its own function, format, and rules for communication.


| Protocol Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Network Communications Protocol** | Protocols enable two or more devices to communicate over one or more networks.<br><br>The Ethernet family of technologies involves a variety of protocols such as:<br><br>IP<br>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)<br>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)<br><br>etc.<br>              |
| **Network Security Protocols**      | Protocols secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption. <br><br>Examples of source protocols include:<br><br>SSH (Secure Shell)<br>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)<br>TLS (Transport Layer Security).                                                                                                  |
| **Routing Protocols**               | Protocols enable routers to exchange route information.<br><br>Compare path information, and then to select the best path to the destination network.<br><br>Examples of routing protocols include, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)                                                           |
| **Service Discovery Protocols**     | Protocols are used for the automatic detection of devices or services.<br><br>Examples of service discovery protocols include:<br><br>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which discovers services for IP address allocation.<br><br>DNS (Domain Name System), which is used to perform name-to-IP address translation. |
