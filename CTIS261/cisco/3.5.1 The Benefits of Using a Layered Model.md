Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and understand. For this reason, a layered model is used to modularize the operations of a network into manageable layers.

These are the benefits of using a layered model to describe network protocols and operations:
- Assisting in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below.
- Fostering competition because products from different vendors can work together
- **Preventing technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above and below**
- **Providing a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities.**

There are two layered models that are used to describe network operations:
- Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
- TCP/IP Reference Model
