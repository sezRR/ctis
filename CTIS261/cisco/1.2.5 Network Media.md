Communication transmits across a network on media.

The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:
- Metal wires within cables (copper): Data is encoded into electrical impulses
- Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable): Data is encoded into pulses of light
- Wireless transmission: Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

Four main criteria for choosing network media:
- What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
- What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
- What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
- What is the cost of the media installation?

To summarize the criteria:
- Distance
- Environment
- Data size/speed
- Cost of installation
