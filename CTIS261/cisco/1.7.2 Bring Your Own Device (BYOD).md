The concept of any device, for any content, in any manner, is a major global trend that requires significant changes to the way we use devices and safely connect them to networks. This is called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

> the practice of allowing the employees of an organization to use their own computers, smartphones, or other devices for work purposes.

BYOD enables end users the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network.

With the growth of consumer devices, and the related drop in the cost, employees and students may have advanced computing and networking devices for personal use. These includes:
- Laptops
- Notebooks
- Tablets
- Smart phones
- E-readers

These may be purchased by the company or school, purchased by the individual, or both.

BYOD means any device, with any ownership, used anywhere.
