The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks, or internet for short).

LANs use WAN services to interconnect.

Some of the LAN examples are connected to each other through a WAN connection. WANs are then connected to each other. WANs can connect through copper wires, fiber-optic cables, and wireless transmissions.

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. Ensuring effective communication across this diverse infrastructure requires the application of consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards as well as the cooperation of many network administration agencies.

There are organizations that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of internet protocols and processes. These organizations include the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), etc.
