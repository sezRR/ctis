There are two types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.

## Physical Topology Diagram
Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation. Ex, the rooms in which devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

## Logical Topology Diagrams
Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network. Ex, end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.
