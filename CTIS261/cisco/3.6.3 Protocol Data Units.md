As application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media, various protocol information is added at each level. This is known as the encapsulation process.

The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a "protocol data unit (PDU)".

During encapsulation, each succeeding layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the layer above in accordance with the protocol is being used.

At each stage of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions. Although there is no universal naming convention for PDUs, we are going to use the PDU names according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite.

The PDUs for each form of data are shown in the figure:

Data - The general term for the PDU used at the application layer
Segment - Transport Layer PDU (**Note:** If the Transport header is TCP, then it is a segment. If the Transport header is UDP then it is a datagram.)
Packet - Network Layer PDU
Frame - Data Link Layer PDU
Bits - Physical Layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium.
