All computers that connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.

Hosts can be called as end devices. Some hosts can be called as clients. However, the term host specifically refers to device on the network that are assigned an IP Address for communication purposes.

IP Address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information to other end devices on the network.
