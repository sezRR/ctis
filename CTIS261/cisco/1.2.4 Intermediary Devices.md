Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network. They can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork.

Intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

Intermediary devices use the destination end device address, in conjunction with information about the network interconnections, to determine the path that messages should take through the network.

Intermediary network devices perform some or all of these functions:
- Regenerate and retransmit communication signals
	- Also see, Degradation Phenomena: ![[1.2.4 Intermediary Devices - Excalidraw]]
- Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and internetwork
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
- Direct data along alternate pathways when there is a link failure
- Classify and direct messages according to priorities
- Permit or deny the flow of data, based on security settings
