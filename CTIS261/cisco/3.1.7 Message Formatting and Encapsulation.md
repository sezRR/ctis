When a message is sent from source to destination, it must use a specific format or structure.

Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.

Similar to sending a letter, a message that is sent over a computer network follows specific format rules for it to be delivered and processed.

Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol with a similar function to the envelope example.

The fields of the Internet Protocol version6 (IPv6) packet identify the source of the packet and its destination. IP is responsible for sending a message from the message source to destination over one or more networks.
