A protocol suite is a set of protocols that work together to provide comprehensive network communication services.

Since the 1970s there have been several different protocol suites, some developed by a standards organization and others developed by various vendors.

During the evolution of network communications and the internet there were several competing protocol suites:

- **Internet Protocol Suite or TCP/IP:** This is the most common and relevant protocol suite used today. The *TCP/IP* protocol suite is an open standard protocol suite maintained by the *Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)*.
<br>
- **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Protocols:** This is a family of protocols developed jointly in 1977 by the *International Organization for Standardization (ISO)* and the *International Telecommunication Union (ITU)*. The OSI protocol also include a seven-layer model called the *OSI Reference Model*. The OSI Reference Model categorizes the functions of its protocols. Today OSI is mainly known for its layered model. The OSI protocols have largely been replaced by TCP/IP.

- **AppleTalk:** A short-lived proprietary protocol suite released by *Apple Inc.* in 1985 for Apple devices. In 1995, Apple adopted TCP/IP to replace AppleTalk.

- **Novell NetWare:** A short-lived proprietary protocol suite and network operating system developed by *Novell Inc.* in 1983 using the *IPX Network Protocol*. In 1995, Novell adopted TCP/IP to replace IPX.
