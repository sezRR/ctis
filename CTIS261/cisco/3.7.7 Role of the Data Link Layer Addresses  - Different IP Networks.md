When the sender and receiver of the IP packet are on different networks, the Ethernet data link frame cannot be sent directly to the destination host because the host is not directly reachable in the network of the sender.

The Ethernet frame must be sent to another device known as the router or default gateway.

In the given example below, the default gateway is R1. R1 has an Ethernet data link address that is on the same network as PC1. This allows PC1 to reach the router directly.

- **Source MAC address** - The Ethernet MAC address of the sending device, PC1. The MAC address of the Ethernet interface of PC1 is *AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA*.
- **Destination MAC address** - When the receiving device, the destination IP address, is on a different network from the sending device, the sending device uses the Ethernet MAC address of the default gateway or router. In the given example below, the destination MAC address is the MAC address of the R1 Ethernet interface, *11-11-11-11-11-11*. This is the interface that is attached to the same network as PC1.

The Ethernet frame with the encapsulated IP packet can now be transmitted to R1.

R1 forwards the packet to the destination, Web Server. This may mean that R1 forwards the packet to another router or directly to Web Server if the destination is on a network connected to R1.

It is important that the IP address of the default gateway be configured on each host on the local network. All packets to a destination on remote networks are sent tot the default gateway.
